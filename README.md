Madad is a project for the differently abled people specific to those who have hearing impairment. It provides an end-to-end solution for the deaf community. It addresses three major problems faced by the deaf people.

1) Missing out general and emergency announcements: (Madad comes with a smart band and an iOS application with the capacility of distinguishing announcements from the background noise using noise reduction algorithm, the announcement is in arabic (can be any other language) which is translated into english language and converted from speech to text. The text is categorized into two categories; general announcements and emergency announcements using text categorization algorithms. Based on the category a relevant number of vibrations is sent to the smart band (using E266 and node nmc module) and a notification is sent to the iOS application where the announcement can also be viewed in sign language.

2) Know your surroundings: When a deaf person is in a new place and they want information about the place so they can tap at locations around them in the app and view the videos about the place in sign language

3) SOS Service: In case of an emergency where a deaf person wants to notify concerned people around, the Madad app can send their location and an emergency message to the admin monitoring application, The person can choose from the emergency icons given or can make a video in sign language and send
